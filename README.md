Problem: 
		We canâ€™t find the latest designs in dresses, shoes, jeweleries etc. quickly because there are many Sites and we must search manually for that. 
		Since it is time consuming many face a problem finding time.
Solution:
		I want to build an android application that connects with the RestApis such as Amazon, eBay and find the details of latest arrivals from each category.
		This will reduce time because it is available on your mobile device from a touch of a button. 
		I hope add the function of viewing the reviews on an item so the user can easily decide according to the past experience of buyers.
