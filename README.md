Problem - in day to day life we eat almost same things. But whenever we want to prepare something special, for an occasion of when we are alone, we want to make the best out of the ingredients we have. Although we can find various recipes from books, they often require another visit to the market. The problem is that there is no convenient application that can find recipes according to the ingredients we have.


 Solution â€“ so I came up with an idea to create an android mobile application which gives suggestions for recipes according to the ingredients we have. After we enter the ingredients we have, app will suggest suitable recipes. I hope to use food2fork API. I Hope to add the feature to save recipes for future reference.
